# SlowTask demo and test application
(c) 2011 Andrew Coulton - released under the Kohana Licence

This very basic app demonstrates how to use the 
[SlowTask module](https://github.com/acoulton/slowtask), and provides an 
environment for the SlowTask unit tests.

It assumes it's in /slowtask-demo/ off your document root, if not you will need
to update .htaccess and bootstrap to the appropriate base url.

For more information see the source code or userguide docs.
